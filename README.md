<h2> This project demonstrates an appointment book interface used by a Veterinarian's office. The appointment book can be filtered and sorted. Appointments can be added, deleted and modified. The appointments are read from json file. </h2>

<h4>This is the basic interface. The Add Appointment form uses the HTML toggle method to hide or show</h4>
